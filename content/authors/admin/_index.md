Hi, I'm an enthusiast Ph.D candidate in Economics. Throughout my thesis, I've been working mainly on the application of a non-parametric technique called Data Enveloppement Analysis in order to improve Algerian public banks' performance. Furthermore, I'm also interested in implementing machine and deep learning algorithms to solve complex real world issues. I'm able to handle several data analytics programs: R, Python, SQL, Excel and Power BI, although I'm more fluent using R and Rstudio. In this context, I'm a [certified RStudio instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/). 

I'm the author of the following R packages: 
- [ralger](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ralger) that facilitates to the maximum web scraping in R. 
- [BARIS](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BARIS) for working with French Open Data Portal API. 
- [farrell](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=farrell) for interactive Data Envelopment Analysis modeling. 
- [batata](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=batata) for R packages easy removal. 
- [GomoGomonoMi](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GomoGomonoMi), for text animation in RMarkdown documents and Shiny apps. 
- [scrollrevealR](https://github.com/feddelegrand7/scrollrevealR) allows you to animate shiny elements when they scroll into view.
- [algo](https://github.com/feddelegrand7/algo) implements the [Algolia Places](https://community.algolia.com/places/) Address Search Auto Completion Menu on Shiny Text Inputs.
