```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(mailtoR)

use_mailtoR()
```


Recently, I was reading a cool blog post by [Martin Chan](https://martinctc.github.io/index.html). I was curious to see how they've implemented the [googlesheets4](https://github.com/tidyverse/googlesheets4) package to collect and monitor data, (I know I could have checked their Github repo but I had a precise question). When I clicked the __Contact me__ icon, this happened:

I really want to stress out that the problems comes from me. I'm a lazy person and I don't know why I've never been able to set up my email software manager. This is my kryptonite. For lazy people like me, I wanted to share this solution.

Recently, I've developed a small package called [mailtoR](https://github.com/feddelegrand7/mailtoR) which deals with this kind of issues. To see what it does, click `r mailtoR(email = "ihaddaden.fodeil@gmail.com", text = "here", subject = "pizza quattro formaggi", body = "Hey buddy, you deserve a quattro formaggi pizza !!!")` and choose your preferred email service. 


See ? I've used the following code but in an inline fashion:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

library(mailtoR)

use_mailtoR() # This function is mandatory

mailtoR(email = "ihaddaden.fodeil@gmail.com", 
        text = "here", 
        subject = "pizza quattro formaggi", 
        body = "Hey buddy, you deserve a quattro formaggi pizza !!!")
```


Thanks !!!
