The [scrollrevealR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=scrollrevealR) package allows you to animate Shiny elements when they scroll into view. Quite interesting if you want to add a fancy touch to your app. `scrollrevealR` is based on the great JavaScript library [scrollreveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/). 

In this context, I gave a presentation of the package at the [Bristol R User Group](https://twitter.com/BristolRUsers) virtual meet up. Feel free to check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/84g6NDDGiZw)
