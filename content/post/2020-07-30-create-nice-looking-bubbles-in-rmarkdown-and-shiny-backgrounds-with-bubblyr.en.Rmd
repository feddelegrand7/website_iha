Recently, I've created a package called `bubblyr` that allows you to render nice looking bubbles in Rmarkdown documents and Shiny applications. It's extremely easy to use ! you only need to implement one function and choose a theme. You can have a look at the available themes [here](https://github.com/feddelegrand7/bubblyr). You can also specify the text color with the `color` argument.

```{css, echo=FALSE}


@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Merriweather:wght@700&display=swap');


body{font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;}
                                      
                                      
```




```{r}

library(bubblyr)

bubbly(theme = "gravitas")


```



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)


ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#4C8591")


```
