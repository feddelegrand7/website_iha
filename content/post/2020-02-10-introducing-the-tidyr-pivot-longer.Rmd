When working with a dataframe, it's usually preferable that you respect the philosophy introduced by [Hadley Wickham](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) about the **Tidy** data where each variable has its own column and each observation its own row. 

So, what would you do when you encounter a "non-tidy" dataframe ?

You would surely consider using the [tidyr package](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr) which provides two important functions: `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`. In this short tutorial, we'll introduce the `pivot_longer()`. This function transforms several columns into a **column name** and a **column value**, thus making the dataframe longer.


Let's dive into one example. We use the recent [wpp2017 package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wpp2017/wpp2017.pdf) which provides several interesting datasets to work with. In our case, we'll work with the **migration** data:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(wpp2017)

data("migration")
head(migration)

```

We can check the structure of our data using `glimpse()`:

```{r}

migration %>% glimpse()

```


You see that the **dates** column should preferably be structured into two columns: A column that we may call **time_period** and a calumn that we call **net_migration_value**. With `pivot_longer()` its extremely easy to do that: 

```{r}

migration %>% pivot_longer(
  
  cols = 3:32,  # The columns that we want to pivot
  
  names_to = "time_period", # the name of the new column name
  
  values_to = "net_migration_value", # the name of the new column value
  
  
)



```
And that's it `r emo::ji("smile")` !
