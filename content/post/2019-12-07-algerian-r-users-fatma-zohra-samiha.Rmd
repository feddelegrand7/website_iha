### I know that at ENSSEA, we teach mostly Eviews and SPSS, how did you come to use R ? 


> I was introduced to the R world thanks to our time series professor, madam **Chaouech Saloua** who asked us to use to make a forecast using R and another software of our choice. I suddenly felt in love with R, getting the required results with few lines of code was magical. 


### Nice ! did you use base R or a specific package to make your forecast ? 

> I used the [forecast](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast/forecast.pdf) package which provides the great `auto.arima()` function. 

### What was your master research topic ? 

> My master thesis treated the Application of supervised machine learning models in order to predict customer chern at Djezzy company. 

### So, a machine learning subject, quite ambitious, which model did you implement ? 


> I benchmarked three algorithms: logistic regression, Linear Support Vector Machine and random forest. The best performance was reached by the linear SVM model. 


### Interesting, you should have a strong knoweledge in Machine Learning which is a great asset nowadays. As such I assume you're looking for a job related to data, right ? 

> Indeed, I'm looking for a data analyst position, preferably within the medical or telecommunication sector.  


### I hope you'll find your dream job very soon where you'll apply your expertise in data analysis and machine learning. 

### Finally, do you have a message to the current ENSSEA students who might read this article ? 


> I would like to invite all the ENSSEA students to use R instead of the classical commercial softwares because according to me R reperesents the future of data analysis. 


### Well thank you very much Miss Samiha for sharing your R experience with us. I hope you'll contribute with Miss Kamila Benadrouche to establish the first Algerian R-ladies group. Of course, people can contact you at Khenaka-samiha_enssea@hotmail.com
