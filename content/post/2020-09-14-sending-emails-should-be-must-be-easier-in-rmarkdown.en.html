<p>Recently, I was reading a cool blog post by <a href="https://martinctc.github.io/index.html">Martin Chan</a>. I was curious to see how they’ve implemented the <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/googlesheets4">googlesheets4</a> package to collect and monitor data, (I know I could have checked their Github repo but I had a precise question). When I clicked the <strong>Contact me</strong> icon, this happened:</p>

<p>I really want to stress out that the problems comes from me. I’m a lazy person and I don’t know why I’ve never been able to set up my email software manager. This is my kryptonite. For lazy people like me, I wanted to share this solution.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve developed a small package called <a href="https://github.com/feddelegrand7/mailtoR">mailtoR</a> which deals with this kind of issues. To see what it does, click <a class="mailtoui" href="mailto:ihaddaden.fodeil@gmail.com?subject=pizza%20quattro%20formaggi&amp;cc=&amp;bcc=&amp;body=Hey%20buddy,%20you%20deserve%20a%20quattro%20formaggi%20pizza%20!!!">here</a> and choose your preferred email service.</p>
<p>See ? I’ve used the following code but in an inline fashion:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(mailtoR)

use_mailtoR() # This function is mandatory

mailtoR(email = &quot;ihaddaden.fodeil@gmail.com&quot;, 
        text = &quot;here&quot;, 
        subject = &quot;pizza quattro formaggi&quot;, 
        body = &quot;Hey buddy, you deserve a quattro formaggi pizza !!!&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Thanks !!!</p>
