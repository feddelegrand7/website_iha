The `creature` packages is aimed for lonely R users. With one line of code, create a cool creature and play with it. There are many parameters that you can tune to create something unique to you.


### Limitation: All the creatures that you create will live at the bottom of your Rmd document/Shiny app no matter where the code is executed. 

All the credit goes to [Justin Windle](https://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/), I just brought the creature to the [#RStats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query) universe. 


```{css, echo = FALSE}

body{background:#1E1E1E;
     color: #F2F2F2; }


```


```{r}

library(creature)

create_creature(interactive = FALSE,
                color = "#324C63",
                tentacles = 100,
                tickness = 20,
                friction = 0.3,
                gravity = 0,
                wind = 2)
 

```
